# Syllabus Research Methods and Quantitative Analysis (RMQA)

## Objectives of this course

The goal of this course is for students to learn the necessary skills to do data analysis. Data analysis is a powerful tool for practical business and empirical research to gain new insights. It is an important competence in today's world given the significant increase in data availabiltiy. In order to successfully apply data analysis the following three building blocks need to understood:

- fundamental statistical concepts
- programming language to apply these concepts on real data
- visualization techniques to communicate findings 

This course will be a blend of all three building blocks. 

## Programming language

Typical statistical classes (especially in business administration) did focus primarily on the first of the three building blocks. In this course all statistical concepts are implemented using the programming language `Python` [(see here)](https://www.python.org/). We will be using real world (or realistic but synthetic) data sets to emphasize and illustrate important concepts. 

`Python` is an all purpose programming language which has significantly gained in popularity in the last 10 years especially for the field of data science and machine learning. 

Why `Python`:

- easy to learn (feels almost like pseudo code)
- very suitable for data analysis and probably most popular language for field of machine learning / deep learning
- popularity also due to programming environment `Jupyter Notebooks` [(see here)](https://jupyter.org/) which enables mixing of text and code and is very suitable for exploratory analysis often required in business and research
- all purpose programming language so not limited to data analysis (such as `R`)
- switch between `R` and `Python` and vice versa is quite straight forward 



## Means of learning

Course will be taught using flipped classroom principle. Therefore, all students are required to prepare before each lecture by  

- reading required material (e.g. python tutorials)
- conducting required analyses

## Grading

- 50% assignments
- 50% final exam

## Exercises & Assignments

Two alternative ways of completing exercises / assignments:  

(1) on local computer (requires installation of Python)
